"""
PASCAL TRIANGLE
-----------------------------
You are given an integer N. Your task is to return a 2-D ArrayList
containing the pascalâ€™s triangle till the row N.
A Pascal's triangle is a triangular array constructed by summing
adjacent elements in preceding rows. Pascal's triangle contains the
values of the binomial coefficient.

For example, given integer N= 4 then you have to print.
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1

Here for the third row, you will see that the second element is the
summation of the above two-row elements i.e. 2=1+1, and similarly
for row three 3 = 1+2 and 3 = 1+2.

#   There can be 2 more variations to this Question
#   1. Print the nth row of Pascal's Triangle
#   2. Print the element at ith row, jth column
#
#   We'll be coding for all the 3 variations of the problem.

        for c in range(1, r):
